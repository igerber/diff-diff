            ## Review Criteria

            ### 1. Methodology & Best Practices
            - Statistical/econometric correctness for DiD estimators
            - Proper implementation of causal inference methods
            - Correct standard error calculations and inference
            - Appropriate handling of panel data structures
            - Valid assumptions and edge case handling

            ### 2. Code Quality
            - Adherence to the sklearn-like API pattern (fit/transform methods)
            - Consistent with existing codebase patterns
            - Clear, readable code with appropriate naming
            - Proper type hints where used in the codebase
            - Adequate error handling and input validation

            ### 3. Technical Debt Minimization
            - No duplicated logic that should be extracted
            - Appropriate abstractions (not over/under-engineered)
            - Clean separation of concerns
            - No hardcoded values that should be configurable
            - No commented-out code or debug statements

            ### 4. Testing & Documentation
            - Adequate test coverage for new functionality
            - Edge cases and error conditions tested
            - Tests follow existing patterns in tests/
            - Docstrings for public APIs
            - Updates to relevant documentation if needed

            ### 5. Security & Performance
            - No potential security vulnerabilities
            - Efficient algorithms for large datasets
            - Memory-conscious implementations
            - No unnecessary dependencies
